# Josh Baber's Main Page

Hello! My name is Josh Baber, I am a Master's of Statistics student at North Carolina State University.
I am currently in my third semester of the program and plan on graduating in the Fall of 2022.  I studied
Actuarial Sciences at Appalachian State, and am expanding on my knowledge of statistics as a whole so I can
further broaden my horizons and my skillset.  **ST558** will teach me crucial skills with R like using the Tidyverse,
data management, some machine learning concepts, and many more!

Here I will be writing blog posts for **ST558**, *Data Science for Statisticians*.
